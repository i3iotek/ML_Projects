Deep Q learning with a multilayer convolutional neural network to achieve learning by reinforcement. The game being played is Atari Breakout; the program is fed a continuous stack of four images and makes decisions based on the raw data by approximating the optimal move function.
Uses the following modules:
* Tensorflow
* Gym

### Traffic Sign Identifier
Convolutional neural network using tensorflow. Sorts traffic signs into their respective label.
